# My NixOS configs.

Just my own personal repo for my systems.

## Theme
I imported the rose-pine color scheme into stylix,

All the non-stylix themes are from `https://github.com/rose-pine`
(some have slight modifications I point out in comments)

Firefox Theme: https://github.com/rose-pine/firefox
Alacritty Theme: https://github.com/rose-pine/alacritty
